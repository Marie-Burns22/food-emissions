Introduction
This application is intended for students to collaborate as they research greenhouse gas emissions from their diet.
Students create an account with name, email, and password.
Logged in students add foods with greenhouse gas emissions and source of the data.

Install instructions:
Clone and run bundle install, rake db:migrate and shotgun.

A seed file is included that uses auto generated names. Foods were not an option in the generator so plant names are used.
